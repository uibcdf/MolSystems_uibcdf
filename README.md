# TestSystems

This has to be the repository of systems to be commonly used to test computational approaches.
The procedure has to be similar to what is used in j. chodera's lab. 
Though there is room for systems prepared for gromacs or amber, this repo has to be prepared to import the systems easily with openmm.
